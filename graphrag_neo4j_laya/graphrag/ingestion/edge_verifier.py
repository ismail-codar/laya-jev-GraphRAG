Continuous Edge Pruning via Laya.

From idea.md §3 (Ingestion / Edge Verification):
    "Continuous Edge Pruning: Run Laya in the background, asking for a score
     on edge validity.  Delete mathematically illogical connections."

The verifier iterates over all edges in Neo4j and asks Laya to evaluate
whether each relationship is logically valid.  Edges scoring below the
prune threshold are deleted from the graph.

Usage
-----
    verifier = EdgeVerifier(neo4j_client)
    stats = verifier.run_full_verification(prune_threshold=0.3)
