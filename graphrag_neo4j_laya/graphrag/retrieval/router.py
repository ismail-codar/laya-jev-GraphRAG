Intent Router — Phase 2 Pre-Traversal Function #1 (functions.md)

Uses the CHOICE primitive to route queries to one of three strategies:
    local      → Score-Gated BFS (single-hop, low-latency)
    multi_hop  → Semantic A* Search (multi-hop, idea.md §4)
    global     → Community summary synthesis (high-level, broad)

The Choice primitive is semantically correct here:
  - It selects ONE option from a predefined set
  - Each option has a natural-language description
  - The decision model (Laya or Jev) picks the best fit in a single call
